My aliases
===================
2016-10-13



Just had a (my first) hard drive failure yesterday, with no time machine (a lot of fun).

My hundreds? of aliases, and much more lost.

So, why not put my aliases in the cloud?

(And also I've became a TimeMachine user by the way)

That's what this list is about.


The simplest thing to do is probably copy paste the myalias.sh file content (in this repo) into your ~/.bash_profile file.


Good luck.
